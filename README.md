This is a repository with the C# maze generation algorithm from The Jamis Buck's blog
The blog's website is here:https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/

Repository Description:
- There are twelve algorithms to generate various mazes
- All algorithms is derived from the Base Class——MazeGenerationAlgorithm
- It works very well,you can see how each algorithm works with the visual process.
